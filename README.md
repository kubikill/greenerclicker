# Greener Clicker
A short incremental game about turning everything green, made in 72 hours for the [Clicker Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/mrquickgame-clicker-jam-2).

The only difference between this version and the version submitted for the jam is that the playtime now displays correctly when the game ends.

# Greener Clicker
A short incremental game about turning everything green, made in 72 hours for the [Clicker Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/mrquickgame-clicker-jam-2) in May 2019.

The only differences between this version and the version submitted for the jam is that the playtime now displays correctly when the game ends and the localStorage item names were changed to avoid conflicting with items from other sites on the same domain.
